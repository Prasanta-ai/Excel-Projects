Features :
      1. Automated Data Processing: Uses a calculation chain and Pivot Caches to handle and update sales records efficiently. 2. Interactive Visualization: Includes three dynamic charts with custom color themes for clear performance comparison. 3. Multi-Dimensional Analysis: Features four distinct Pivot Tables to slice data by region, executive, and timeframe. 4. VBA Automation: Integrated Macro module (vbaProject.bin) to streamline dashboard updates and reporting tasks. 5. Advanced Filtering: Utilizes Slicers and control properties to allow users to drill down into specific regional metrics.

  
1. Dataset View (Raw Data Layer)
The dataset serves as the backbone of the workbook, organized to capture granular sales activities.
     1. Executive Metadata: Contains unique employee codes and names for each sales representative.

     2. Regional Categorization: Data is segmented by geographical regions including Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Nagpur, Pune, Ranchi, Surat, and Patna.

     3. Daily Performance Tracking: Records individual sales figures across a 5-day period (Day 1 through Day 5).

     4. Goal Parameters: Sets a standardized performance target of 500 units for every executive to measure variance.

     5. Calculated Metrics: Includes real-time calculations for "Total Sales," "Target Hit %," and "Away From Target %".

2. Dashboard View (Analytics Layer)
The dashboard transforms the raw dataset into a high-level summary for stakeholders using advanced Excel features.
     1. Pivot Table Summaries: Utilizes four distinct pivot tables to aggregate sales by region and executive performance.
      
     2. Dynamic Visuals: Features three interactive charts (generated via chart1.xml, chart2.xml, and chart3.xml) that visualize trends and target achievements.
      
     3. Interactive Slicers: Includes a slicer interface (slicer1.xml) that allows users to filter the entire dashboard by specific regions or criteria with one click.
      
     4. Custom Theming: Applied professional color palettes and styles to ensure the charts and tables are presentation-ready.
      
     5. Macro-Driven Updates: The dashboard interface is supported by VBA automation to ensure that visual elements refresh instantly when the underlying dataset changes
